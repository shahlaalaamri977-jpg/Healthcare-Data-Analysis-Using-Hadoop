# Healthcare Data Analysis Using Hadoop

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Apache Hadoop MapReduce to analyze healthcare data in a distributed environment. The analysis focuses on computing average health metrics such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and Body Mass Index (BMI) using Java-based MapReduce programs.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Stroke Prediction Dataset** obtained from Kaggle. It contains health-related attributes including age, gender, BMI, average glucose level, and other medical indicators. Although the dataset includes a stroke prediction attribute, this project focuses on descriptive data analysis rather than predictive modeling.
